Lesson 2 Reflections:

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: It creates the repository itself, and we need to do that in order to use the Git tools. 

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Its different because its a intermediate area, and the value thats offers is that we have more control over files.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: I can use the "git diff --staged" command to check how much changes I made in the staging area.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: Situations of creating a new function, translation, mode, etc...
 and branches will help to make every situation to be treated differently so it wont be mixed on the master branch.
