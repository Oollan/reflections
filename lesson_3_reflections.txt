Lesson 3 Reflections:

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I work with people and we need to sync our files.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Its the best to pull changes manually because I'm having the best control over the repository.
