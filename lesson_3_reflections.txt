Lesson 3 Reflections:

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I work with people and we need to sync our files.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Its the best to pull changes manually because I'm having the best control over the repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are clones on the GitHub servers, clones are copies of repositories, and branches are sub repositories for utility work.
 I'll use each of them for their own purposes, the forks on GitHub, the clones every time I'll need to copy a repository,
  and the branches for my own utility work.
  
Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: The benefit is that you synchronized and won't have conflicts with the remote.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: I could collaborate by sharing files on Google Drive, but it would be hard.
 I guess there are no easy way to do it with good management.
 
Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: Making changes in a separate branch is more of a clean way, its good to be done always, while making changes in master branch is
 easier but dirty, so its preferred to use separate branches.
